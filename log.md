**Today's Progress**: Completed every challenge about HTML5 and CSS of freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I'm learnig a lot of things about CSS in these days. I know I have a lot of stuffs to learn but now I can start to do a very simple web site page. I'm happy!

**Today's Progress**: I learned the usage of some particular concepts about a more responsive web app completing 14 challenges of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning slowly but I thing I didn't forget nothing. I spent a lot of time to nest a font awesome icon in a like button and I'm feeling so bad. I don't lose hope.
