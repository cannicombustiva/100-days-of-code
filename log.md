### Day1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned the usage of some particular concepts about a more responsive web app completing 14 challenges of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning slowly but I thing I didn't forget nothing. I spent a lot of time to nest a font awesome icon in a like button and I'm feeling so bad. I don't lose hope.

### Day2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I discoveerd jQuery completing every challenge of freeCodeCamp. Now I know hot to change some contenents in a HTML page using jQuery script. 

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to see the utility about jQuery but I can't. Ok, it's cool to use the scripts in the same HTML file, but In my opinion it's better to modify tags classes etc directly in the HTML Frameworks. 


### Day3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: In according to freeCodeCamp challange I had to do a personal portfolio but I gave up on it because I looked at other users projects and I observed they used js framework, so I restart a javascript course on freecodecamp. Amazing!

**Thoughts**: A lot of time ago I completed a js course, but I think my knowledge is not enough to do some projects. I can do more and more so at the moment I'll improve my skills about javaScript. 

### Day4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied js course on freeCodeCamp. I refreshed my mind about some structures. Really interesting!

**Thoughts**: I'm on my way now. I'm focussing my target. I love coding!

### Day5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally I understand the difference between local&global scopes in javaScript.

**Thoughts**: At the beginning when I studied this course, it was hard for my mind to use scopes. For me it's an important achievement. I feel very good.

### Day6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the basic js course on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I realize that I love this world. Thanks to this challenge I am experiencing so much satisfaction that the university I can not see. 

### Day7: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent 2 hours to finish the 'Make Object Properties Private' challenge.

**Thoughts**: Honestly, I think I didn't make progress because I'm not able to use public and private properties as well as I wish. It's frustrating...

### Day8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned some methods in javaScript like .filter, .reverse ect ect.

**Thoughts**: I think that methods will be very usefull in my study. Anyway, THIS IS THE 8th DAY! congratz to me!!! 

### Day9: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' on freeCodeCamp. I spent several time to made a working code about searching the longest string. 

**Thoughts:**: I'm learning how to apply what I studied. At university I worked on the C language and I'm seeing that JS is very powerful and useful.

### Day10: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I still play with 'Basic Algorithm Script'. I discovered some methods about substring, control string/array.

**Thoughts:**: Amazing! I'm growing day by day. 10 days ago I wasn't able to build a tribut page or I didn't know bootstrap.

### Day11: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML and JS files to build my Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:**: Every day I'm doing useful things. This #100daysofCode challenge is powerful.
