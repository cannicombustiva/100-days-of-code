**Today's Progress**: I learned the usage of some particular concepts about a more responsive web app completing 14 challenges of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning slowly but I thing I didn't forget nothing. I spent a lot of time to nest a font awesome icon in a like button and I'm feeling so bad. I don't lose hope.

**Today's Progress**: I discoveerd jQuery completing every challenge of freeCodeCamp. Now I know hot to change some contenents in a HTML page using jQuery script. 

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to see the utility about jQuery but I can't. Ok, it's cool to use the scripts in the same HTML file, but In my opinion it's better to modify tags classes etc directly in the HTML Frameworks.
