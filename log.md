### Day1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned the usage of some particular concepts about a more responsive web app completing 14 challenges of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning slowly but I thing I didn't forget nothing. I spent a lot of time to nest a font awesome icon in a like button and I'm feeling so bad. I don't lose hope.

### Day2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I discoveerd jQuery completing every challenge of freeCodeCamp. Now I know hot to change some contenents in a HTML page using jQuery script. 

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to see the utility about jQuery but I can't. Ok, it's cool to use the scripts in the same HTML file, but In my opinion it's better to modify tags classes etc directly in the HTML Frameworks. 


### Day3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: In according to freeCodeCamp challange I had to do a personal portfolio but I gave up on it because I looked at other users projects and I observed they used js framework, so I restart a javascript course on freecodecamp. Amazing!
**Thoughts**: A lot of time ago I completed a js course, but I think my knowledge is not enough to do some projects. I can do more and more so at the moment I'll improve my skills about javaScript. 

### Day4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied js course on freeCodeCamp. I refreshed my mind about some structures. Really interesting!
**Thoughts**: I'm on my way now. I'm focussing my target. I love coding!

### Day5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally I understand the difference between local&global scopes in javaScript.
**Thoughts**: At the beginning when I studied this course, it was hard for my mind to use scopes. For me it's an important achievement. I feel very good.
