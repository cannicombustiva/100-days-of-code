**Today's Progress**: I learned the usage of some particular concepts about a more responsive web app completing 14 challenges of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning slowly but I thing I didn't forget nothing. I spent a lot of time to nest a font awesome icon in a like button and I'm feeling so bad. I don't lose hope.<!--
